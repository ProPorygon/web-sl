# web-sl
A web-based steam ascii animation steam locomotive based off Toyoda Masashi's [sl command](https://github.com/mtoyoda/sl). All credit for the ascii art goes to Toyoda Masashi.

Even more pointless than `sl` since it's not even in your terminal. But I guess you can use it to troll people or something.
